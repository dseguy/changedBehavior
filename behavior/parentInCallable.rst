PHP supports a callable syntax, based on array: it must be an array of two elements, where the index 0 is the object or the class, and the index 1 is the method name.



Until PHP 8.2, it was possible to use the keyword ``parent``, to make the callable work with the parent class. 



In the example, parent would be calling the static method ``replace``, in A, or any other parent. 



Since PHP 8.2, this is a deprecated feature, and it will be removed in PHP 9.



PHP code
________
.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   
   class A {
       public static function replace($a) {
       	return 'a';
       }
   }
   
   class B extends A
   {
       public static function work($it) {
   		return preg_replace_callback('~\w+~', array('parent', 'parent::replace'), $it);
       }
   }
   
   echo b::work('abc');
   
   ?>

Before
______
.. code-block:: output

   PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught TypeError: preg_replace_callback(): Argument #2 ($callback) must be a valid callback, cannot access parent when current class scope has no parent 
   
   Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: preg_replace_callback(): Argument #2 ($callback) must be a valid callback, cannot access parent when current class scope has no parent 
   

After
