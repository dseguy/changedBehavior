The never type requires the closure to not return, but the arrow function always returns something. By using die(), that closure doesn't return anymore, but PHP only recognized this since PHP 8.2. Before PHP 8.1, it was valid syntax, as ``never`` was recognized as a class name.

PHP code
________
.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   
   fn($a) : never => die(); 
   

Before
______
.. code-block:: output

   PHP Fatal error:  A never-returning function must not return
   
   Fatal error: A never-returning function must not return
   

After
______
.. code-block:: output
