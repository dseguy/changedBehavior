In PHP 4, the constructor was the method of the same name as the class. They were called during instantiation of an object. In PHP 7, there were replaced with the ``__construct`` method, and were used in case of fallback.



Old constructors are also called ``PHP 4 constructor``, as they were used during that time; they are also called eponymous constructors, as they use the same name as the class.
