PHP allowed the creation of case-insensitive constants with the function ``define``. That was the third parameter to be passed, with a default, and often ignored value of ``false``.



Since PHP 8.0, case-insensitive constants are not possible anymore. Creating a constant with both ``const`` and ``define`` only leads to case-sensitive global constant.



As a reminder, accessing a non-existing constant is a Fatal error, so an error on the case in a global constant leads to it.
