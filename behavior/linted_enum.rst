Two different cases in an enumeration cannot have duplicate values. 



In PHP 8.1, it was a compilation error, and the code would not be executed. 



Since PHP 8.2, it is only checked at execution time, when the enumeration is first used. This means that it may be a hidden bug, until that code is actually used.

PHP code
________
.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   
   enum A : int{
       case A = 1;
       case B = 1;
   }
   
   function foo(?A $x = null) { 
       var_dump($x);
   }
   
   // A is not used, as it default to NULL
   foo();
   
   ?>

Before
______
.. code-block:: output

   Fatal error: Duplicate value in enum A for cases A and B
   

After
______
.. code-block:: output

   NULL


PHP version change
