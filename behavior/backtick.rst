The back tick operator is deprecated, and will be removed in PHP 9.0. It should be replaced with a call to ``shell_exec()``, which is the function equivalent. It may also be replaced with any other dedicated feature: for example, listing files in a directory may be replaced with a call to ``scandir()``.
