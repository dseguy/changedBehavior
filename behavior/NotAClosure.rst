Calling ``Closure`` native methods outside a closure or an arrow function leads to an error message. 



This applies to functions or methods, that are later turned into a closure with the first class callable syntax: while that syntax creates a closure, the underlying code is not a closure, and cannot access the related features.



The warning message, used in previous PHP version, was not as explicit as the new one.

PHP code
________
.. code-block:: php

   <?php
   
   function foo() {
       Closure::getCurrent();
   }
   
   foo(); // Error
   
   foo(...)(); // Error: foo was put inside a closure, but it is still not a closure itself.
   
   ?>

Before
______
.. code-block:: output

   PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method Closure::getCurrent()

After
______
.. code-block:: output

   PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Current function is not a closure
   
   Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Current function is not a closure
