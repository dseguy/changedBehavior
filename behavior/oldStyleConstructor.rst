Since PHP 5, the constructor method of a class was the eponymous method: the method with the same name as the class. 



In PHP 7, this feature was deprecated in favor of using the ``__construct``. During that phase, ``__construct`` had priority over the eponymous function, but the latter was still used in case of fallback, for backward compatibility.



In PHP 8, the eponymous method is now a normal method.
