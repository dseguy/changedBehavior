description = "PHP provides native interfaces: they include methods and their type. Until PHP 8.1, such types were not enforced, for backward compatibility reasons. Nowadays, these types are enforced, just like any other interface. It makes PHP native interfaces on the same footing as custom interfaces.

In case this migration is too ambitious, it is possible to use the ``#[\\ReturnTypeWillChange]`` to suppress the warning.
