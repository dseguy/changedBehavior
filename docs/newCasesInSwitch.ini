description = "With PHP 8.0, the result of comparisons between empty values, such as 0, ``''`` (empty string), or ``[]`` (empty array), have changed. The impact is obvious with the ``==`` operator, and it is less obvious with ``switch``, which relies on the same underlying code.

In particular, when there are several falsy cases in a switch, the selection of cases may be different between PHP versions, like in this illustration. 

In PHP 7.4 and older, ``0 == ''``, so the first case is selected. After PHP 8.0, ``0 != ''``, and the second case is selected.
