description = "str_replace() accepts an array of strings as third argument: it applies all the replacements to all the strings in that arguments.

Until PHP 8.0, it was possible to pass an array of arrays, and the inner arrays would be omitted in the replacement. In PHP 8.0, the objects are cast to a string: ``stringeable`` objects are always converted, while non-``stringeable`` objects yields a Fatal error.

This is also applicable to str_ireplace().";
