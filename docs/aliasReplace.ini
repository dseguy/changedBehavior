description = "When a class is defined before an alias, with ``use``, it used to yield a fatal error. Since PHP 8.4, and when the alias is in a different block than the definition, it is possible to replace a class with another one. 

While the fatal error has been removed, it now means that a class, local to a namespace, is not always described by its relative name. The class is still distinguisable with its absolute name.";
