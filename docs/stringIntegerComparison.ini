description = "The comparison between a string and an integer has changed. In particular, PHP 7 used to convert both operands to integer before comparison, leading to 0 and any string being equal. 

In PHP 8.0 and more recent, this doesn't happen and strings are now different from integers. 

Also, strings used to be smaller than 0, but they are now bigger.";
