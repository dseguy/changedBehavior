description = "strpos() used to accept integer arguments as second argument, ``$needle``. Then, PHP would turn the integer into the equivalent ASCII character, and look for that character.

Since PHP 8.0, it is not the case anymore. If the code requires such behavior, add a call to chr() or mb_chr() to convert the integer to an character, before searching for it.
