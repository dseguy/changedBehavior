"description":"A generator is unpacked as an array, and as such, it doesn't allow keys to be anything else but string or integer. The generator may still be used in a foreach() structure, and yield usable keys, but it can't be unpacked or turned into a array without an error. In previous versions, the keys would be ignored, and re-indexed.",
