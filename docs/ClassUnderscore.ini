This applies to classes, interfaces, traits and enumerations. It applies in every namespace.

It does not applies to functions, although that name is usually a native PHP function from the ``gettext`` extension. It also does not apply to constants, methods, class constants and variables. 

It is still possible to name a class with a longer name, starting with an underscore.

The ``_`` is being reserved for the future pattern matching feature of PHP.";
