description = "The ternary operator used to have a left associativity : it would process first the ``then`` and ``else`` clauses, before executing itself.

Since PHP 8.0, the ternary operator produces a fatal error when the nested ternaries are ambiguous.

The update forces the code to use parenthesis, and set the priorities between the operators explicitely.

This doesn't apply to the ``then`` clause, which is always unambiguous.";
