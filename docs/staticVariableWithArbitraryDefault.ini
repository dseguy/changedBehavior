description = "Static variables are actually variables: as such, they can be inited with the result of a functioncall. 

Until PHP 8.3, their default values were using static constant expression, built around constants and operators. 

Since PHP 8.3, it is possible to also set their first value as a function or method call.

Properties and parameters are not allowed to use these expressions: they must be valid at compile time.";
