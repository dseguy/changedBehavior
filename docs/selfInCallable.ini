description = "PHP supports a callable syntax, based on array: it must be an array of two elements, where the index 0 is the object or the class, and the index 1 is the method name.

Until PHP 8.2, it was possible to use the keyword ``self``, to make the callable dependent on the context of usage of the callable. 

In the example, self would be calling the static method ``replace``, in A. 

Since PHP 8.2, this is a deprecated feature, and it will be removed in PHP 9.";
