description = "setlocale() used to impact several functions, including ``echo``. With the French or German (or other) conventions, the decimal separator is a comma, and PHP makes the conversion at ``echo`` time.

This is not the case anymore in PHP 8.0: anytime the float is converted to a string, the locale formatting is not applied anymore.

It is recommended to make this conversion explicit by using ``printf()``, ``number_format()`` or a custom formatter function.";
