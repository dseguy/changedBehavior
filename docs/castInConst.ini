description = "PHP 8.5 accepts the cast operators in constant expressions. Until then, operators such as ``(int)``, ``(float)``, ``(string)``, ``(array)`` were not allowed.

While using a cast on a literal value is rather meaningless, static constant expressions may be build on top of other constants. 

Then, ``(object)`` is still not accepted, along with ``(void)``. ";
